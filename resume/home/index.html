    <p> My name is Erin Cheng, and I am a senior undergraduate student at Boston University.
        I am majoring in Business Administration, with a concentration in Information Systems. Additionally, I have
        minors in both Economics and Computer Science. This multidisciplinary approach to my education reflects my  keen
        interest in understanding the broader economic context of business decisions, as well as developing technical
        skills in computer science. After working as a research assistant in Finance, I have developed a strong interest
        in analytical work, and hope to forge a career in data analytics moving forward. On my free time, I enjoy a
        variety of artistic and athletic hobbies, including cello, guitar, photography, and running.</p>
    <p>Welcome to my website, here you will find my <u>Educational</u> and my <u> Employment</u> history; as well as
        other information that might be of interest to you.</p>
